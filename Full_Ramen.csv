The first thing I noticed was that in the steeping method, it says ‘wait until noodles are tender.’ What’s a little troublesome about this is that you have to keep trying non-tender noodles until they’re the desired consistency. I’d say about 3~4 minutes was about right for me.  I would have liked to see more noodles, although many were eaten while I was figuring out how long they should sit in the mug for. The broth has a salty chicken taste which is very good – I definitely think sipping it out of a mug would be preferable than as displayed here. As far as the chicken, there are bits of chicken here and there and they ended up hydrating well. 1.75 out of 5.0 stars.UPC bar code 041000014802."

Added Hormel Turkey Pepperoni, sliced black olive, coriander and shredded mozzarella cheese. The noodles had a nice way about them – a light crumble and good gauge; definitely from India. The broth has a little thickness to it and a flavor that made me think of the herbs and spices one would add to pizza sauce along with a peppery component. It was fascinating and quite good! 4.0 out of 5.0 stars.  EAN bar code 8906013030671."

Penang is attractive to tourists because of its uniqueness, heritage and it is a cultural city with multi- racial ethnic population. Lack of knowledge and experience, combined with different interest may cause the tourism industry collapse. Cultural Traits and Heritage tourism is discussed as Penang’s opportunity to create tourism platform where resources and market would be kept and at the same time, competition with other World Heritage Cities will be created. Cultural Traits and Heritage recently has become an important topic and concept to tourism development especially in Penang since Penang was awarded as the World Heritage City by UNSECO in July 2008. Hence, in this research, it proposes the links of self representation to current desired outcomes of Penang’s distinctiveness and sustainability of Penang UNESCO award. At the same time, the model also tests how these outcomes influence the destination ability to meet tourists’ expectations and how Penang should act in competing in the global heritage tourism industry."

However, over time, many Penang heritage dishes have been modified so much that what is served today is just a pale image of the original. The tastes of home-cooked dishes have not been faithfully reproduced from one generation to the next. Similarly, street- food and restaurant recipes have not been faithfully passed from a retiring chef to his successor. This book preserves the Penang heritage food from days of yore, covering home- cooked food, street food and restaurant dishes. Meticulously researched, every recipe is prefaced with heritage information and, together, they trace Penang heritage food to its Thai, Hokkien, Hainanese, Indian and Malay roots. Penang Heritage Food won a national award for best culinary history in the World Gourmand World Cookbook Awards."

The tastes of home-cooked dishes have not been faithfully reproduced from one generation to the next. Similarly, street- food and restaurant recipes have not been faithfully passed from a retiring chef to his successor. This book preserves the Penang heritage food from days of yore, covering home- cooked food, street food and restaurant dishes. Meticulously researched, every recipe is prefaced with heritage information and, together, they trace Penang heritage food to its Thai, Hokkien, Hainanese, Indian and Malay roots.

Penang is attractive to tourists because of its uniqueness, heritage and it is a cultural city with multi- racial ethnic population. Lack of knowledge and experience, combined with different interest may cause the tourism industry collapse. Cultural Traits and Heritage tourism is discussed as Penang’s opportunity to create tourism platform where resources and market would be kept and at the same time, competition with other World Heritage Cities will be created. Cultural Traits and Heritage recently has become an important topic and concept to tourism development especially in Penang since Penang was awarded as the World Heritage City by UNSECO in July 2008. Hence, in this research, it proposes the links of self representation to current desired outcomes of Penang’s distinctiveness and sustainability of Penang UNESCO award. At the same time, the model also tests how these outcomes influence the destination ability to meet tourists’ expectations and how Penang should act in competing in the global heritage tourism industry."

Added enormous green onion, sweet onion, Fresno pepper, white mushroom, baby bok choy and fried tofu cutlet. The noodles are perfect – nice ramyun gauge and texture I enjoy thoroughly. The broth is very good – especially for a vegetarian skewed variety. Usually I find anything vegetarian to have this, well, funk to it. This doesn’t have that. It’s very reminiscent of Shin Ramyun, yet a little less spicy. Add to it the fact that it isn’t as heavy; while the broth is very rich and tastes very good, it seems somewhat fresher and light. The hydrated veggies did pretty well. All in all, I’m quite impressed – best Vegan instant ever. 5.0 out of 5.0 stars. UPC bar code 031146022823."
