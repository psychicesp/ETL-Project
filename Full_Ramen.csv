Added Dodo shrimp and fish ball, spring onion, and Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts. Noodles were good and plump – on point as always. The broth is a creamy chowder-like affair with a little spiciness – the pepper rings in the garnish definitely liven things up, should you choose to eat one.

Added baked chicken, Sichuan pepper powder, sesame seed, and spring onion. While the noodle was very nice – a very thin dry noodle from Taiwan, the flavor for this reviewer was horrible. Just can’t win today as this is the third one I’ve had I’ve disliked. The combo of peppers going on here reminds me of the smell of detergents and solvents used to clean a dirty bathroom (note I’m not saying it contains anything like that, I just don’t enjoy the odor).

Then the ramen arrived. The first word that comes to mind is haphazard. The noodles were the right gauge, but didn’t have that floury character to them. The broth was so full of black garlic that it was ultra bitter and the creamy happiness that is tonkotsu was all but masked. The egg was soft boiled, but not marinated and yolks were on the more congealed end of the stick. Chashu was almost definitely Yangtze BBQ pork {the kind you find in American Chinese restaurants with the hot mustard and ketchup). Menma was alright and I was happy with the presence of mung bean sprouts. The bowl altogether just didn’t coalesce into something unique, special, authentic or interesting.

The yakisoba sauce coated everything and without the mayo, this was really good. Bits of cabbage lent a nice crunchiness throughout.

I was kind of taken aback at the sheer amount of water required for this one – 700ml is a lot. However, the noodle block accommodated and we see here a lot of plump noodles. They didn’t come out poorly either – they’re pretty decent. Now for the broth. The broth was something that my flu symptoms didn’t know how to combat. I had a bit of the noodle, then some broth and after about ten seconds, I felt this pain in my gut; like the I’m either going to vomit or shit my pants kind of gut pain. I had taken some cough syrup about a half hour before, too. Was trying these while sick a good idea? Was this a bad batch of noodles? A big yes to the first and a definite no to the second. I would have thought that if anything the spiciness would have been downplayed a bit since my tastebuds are all jacked up, but I have a feeling it amplified the spicy effect. I think the gut pain was the stuff hitting a gut full of medication and post nasal drippings. Luckily, Jay is going to send another pack of these and I will definitely try again once I’m feeling better. One thing I’ll say – this is a lot of noodles and broth and exceedingly spicy as well. After the rematch, I have fcome to a conclusion. This is the spiciest instant noodle I’ve ever had. It burned bad, twsited my gut up, laid waste to my soul. It makes every spicy variety I’ve had thus far taste like sugar water. Not only that, I think it tastes horrible. 0.0 out of 5.0 stars. . 18禁カレーラーメン, you beat my sick self down.

You are greeted warmly  (no pun intended) by a nice sweet kind of flavor at the outset. If you continue to scarf down the noodles, it continues this way. Until you stop.

The broth is indeed less spicy than original Kokomen, but it still has a good punch to it. I would definitely say this is still spicier than many could handle.

I decided not to add anything to see if 80 calories worth of noodles would be filling. The noodles have a very different texture from anything I’ve tried before. Upon chewing, it’s like they collapse upon pressure in an odd way; not exactly crumbling, but condensing perhaps. Reminds me of chewing up a shredded plant substance, maybe like shredded boiled melon. The miso broth was actually quite well done – rich color and good flavor. The vegetables hydrated well in 30 seconds and were good too. As far as the fillingness, yeah. If you eat the whole pack, which isn’t a huge amount really. I think the 40 calories per serving is a little off, since how would one split the serving? I think this is probably to get away from the sodium level, although that too is much lower than most conventional instant noodles. 4.0 out of 5.0 – a pleasant surprise. UPC bar code 853237003371."

It seems to be a melding of beef, smokiness and a little spiciness in an approximation of barbecue sauce, but not quite. What gets me is it tastes exactly like barbecue potato chips. Exactly. The interesting thing about that to me is that when Paldo came out with their Kokomen, I thought it tasted like Jalapeno Cheddar Chee-tos. I think they might be on to something!

Added some green onions. The noodles are of a nice quality – slightly crumbly though. The broth is good – very full of beefiness! I detect slight sweetness, almost like it has something like ketchup in there as well as an interesting tartness. The corn comes together nicely too. So the beef patty is pretty good – it wants to fall apart though. This isn’t any kind of negative though; more of a hint. I found that after I samples each component, I felt that mushing up the patty and evenly distributing the patty throughout the bowl was a must and thoroughly enjoyed it that way.

Added a hard boiled egg with Cavendar’s Greek seasoning, yellow onion, broccoli, green bell pepper and baked chicken with Lindberg-Snider Red Baron BBQ spice. The noodles are slightly different; they are a lot like your domestic instant noodle except that they have a slight crumble to them and an almost chewiness. They are rather plump as well which is nice as far as the comfort-food element goes. The masala flavor is really nice – a little spicy and a good hearty broth. One thing that was interesting with this one is that the directions mention between 375 and 500mL of water – it might not seem like it, but a 1/2 cup is quite a bit when it comes to noodle making. This one had probably 450mL of water added. Anyways, this is good – a nice eastern taste from Fiji. 4.0 out of 5.0 stars. UPC bar code 9416470238606 ."

The crunchy fried onions are an absolute treat. These are great 5.0/5.0 stars noodles. As for the lime juice, I can’t say that I’m any form of authority on lime juice, but its really good with the chicken! I has a crisp and tasty acidity that makes the chicken taste great!

The noodles soaked up most of the liquid and really I must say there is a huge amount of them. The noodles are a little hard to eat; maybe using scissors to cut them before the meal would be helpful as in the way naengmyon is served in Korea. The noodles are thin and don’t separate very well. They aren’t slimy but have a gelatinous texture. They are easily broken by pursing the lips. The broth (what was left after the engorging by the noodles) was interesting,. First, very spicy and has a black pepper taste. Also has an almost vinegary acidity that almost acts like a component of the spiciness. The veggies are disappointing as they don’t really re-hydrate as one would expect. I must say this is a lot better than I expected, but I still definitely cannot eat the the whole thing by any stretch of the imagination. It’s very salty and very heavy. I would say that one of these packs could easily feed two people – kind of has that ‘stick to your ribsy’ kind of way to it like rice and beans in its fillingness.

As I took the first bite of these noodles, I found myself in the same situation, so I tried the scissors – big difference!

After it boiled, I drained off the water and added it. The noodles are thinner than many but they’re great – not crumbly or weak – they’re of good quality. The broth is pretty good – I think it might be a tad less spicy than the old Spicy Kimchi Bowl Noodles – still, I like it. The veggies were pretty good, but not a lot of them. I like this one – adding some things to it to dress it up makes it even better. By itself, I give it 3.75 out of 5.0 stars. Looking at the old review, looks like they improved!

Usually I’ve found that with instant noodle varieties that are about heat are not so much about flavor – this one is spicy as well as tasty. The veggies are there and in a decent amount. I would think this would be great with a little shredded pork, an egg  and some extra veggies as well – and I think next time I may try it with a slice of processed cheese.

So these noodles – they have to be the broadest rice noodles I’ve ever seen – pretty amazing that they stay together being so wide and thin! They’re not too chewy and no mushy either. The broth is very interesting – kind of salty and kind of buttery – but absolutely not fishy. It’s got a thickness to it – not an overly greasy kind of thickness either. Lots of green onion bits here and there – they look nice and maybe add a little flavor to the broth. The Basa fish? Well, there’s not a huge amount of it but it’s good – not really fishy at all – like a whitefish. I will say that I do like Vietnamese catfish instant noodles!

Added some Huy Fong Sriracha hot sauce, Krazy Mixed Up Salt and fried shallots on the eggs. I also dropped some kizami shoga (pickled ginger) in the mix. Wow – this is great stuff! The noodles are chewy enough without being too chewy. The flavor is excellent – like a hot curry beef taste that works so well. I love it.

So let’s dig in. The noodles are good – not very chewy but not low on character; they’re tasty and enjoyable. The broth has a strong spicy flavor. The veggies are all over the place and pretty tasty.

Finally, the eel. It is wonderful – much better than I expected. It ties everything together and adds a nice flavor. If you haven’t had eel before, it’s a very light tasting meat and this being my first time tasting a cooked eel, it has the texture of a slightly chewy tuna and almost a hint of that flavor.

I think others probably would have less trouble with it. I’m giving this a 4.25 out of 5.0! UPC barcode 089686180688 ."

But, the noodles MUST be palatable for any of these to work in my opinion and bean thread here is just too tough to swallow. 2.25 out of 5.0 stars."

Now let’s get down to business. As mentioned before, I added two eggs that cooked in the pot with the noodles. This is pretty standard. The noodles are of a good quality. They are chewy but not overly so. There is also a happy abundance of noodles, making for a decent sized meal. The broth is fine –  nice spiciness that you would expect from Shin Ramyun but it has an added depth and richness. I taste a lot of onion, garlic and meaty tones. As for the veggies and beef, I think that’s where this bowl shines. The beef is excellent – like little pieces of steak amongst the noodles – chewy and they taste fresh and good. The vegetables re-hydrate very nicely – and they aren’t tiny little bits! They’re of a decent size and of good quality. Long story short, I would happily say that this is one of the better South Korean instant noodles I’ve tried, possibly ranking up in the top two or three. I will say I like it better than the original Nong Shim Shin Ramyun as well. I’m giving this one 4.75 out of 5.0 stars. Why not 5.0 stars?

I’ve had pho before; the real thing. This doesn’t even come close – here’s why. First, the noodles in pho are usually strands and not broad. Second, the broth has a richness that a little packet of oil can’t bring to life. Thirdly, sweet basil is a flavor that’s enjoyed throughout the dish and this stuff hasn’t got even a hint of it. Now if I hadn’t ever had pho and I was reviewing it on it’s merits alone (which is how I’m going to rate this), I would say the noodles are mushy, the broth is extremely greasy and almost goopy in its thickness.

More than once I would take a can of Campbell’s soup – often Vegetable, and a pack of Top Ramen and make it together, then bring it back downstairs and ingest it.

I think frying them gives an extra bit of flavor and texture that these don’t have.

It’s almost as if I’ve spent too much time pondering it as I eat it… Its kind of greasy and a little bland and the noodles are kind of odd… I’m not sure about this one. 2.0 out of 5.0 stars.

Ahhh I like this stuff – really comfy. I like to let it sit for a few minutes after cooking so the noodles suck up more of the broth – that really gets it creamy.

Two fried eggs accompany this tasty meal with aplomb. The noodles were perfect as was the broth and veggies. In fact, I noticed a veggies before now never happened upon in my ramen reviewing. It might have been the dried white mushroom or the dried leek chip leaf – I’m not certain, but it was odd and fascinating. So I really liked the noodles – reminded me of the MAMA brand a little bit.  so they’re already seasoned in the packet they have sugar and salt and ingredients as well as tapioca.  I did like them very much. I give this packet of excellent noodles 3.5 out of 5.0 stars."

Then add the soup booster, give it a few stirs and voila! This is the finished product! So this has an interesting flavor. I’m not going to say its very chicken flavored. In fact I would go so far to say that this reminds me of Korean noodles that have a picture of a chili pepper on them. The noodles are pretty good – especially after being microwaved like that. The broth is weird; not a lot of it and it’s spicy but a really nondescript flavor other than ‘hot n spicy’ like the Flamin’ Hot that goes on Chee-Tos. The veggies were ample but I found that they liked to hide a lot. This lack of buoyancy for lack of a better word was kind of disappointing as the waterlogged bits fell short.

For example I had Sapporo Ichiban Miso Ramen. Good stuff but really not very filling. This stuff however is. Lots of noodles – like a tighter woven noodle cake. The noodles are plentiful and just a slight cut above cheapo noodles. The broth is nice although it does have a kind of weird aftertaste that I can’t identify except in that I don’t find it exactly appealing. The veggies were decent. I’m going to give this one 3.25 out of 5.0 stars.

As usual, I am eating these noodles right now to provide the most instantaneous of thoughts upon their worth and quality.
At first try, I found them to be salty and uninteresting; then a little more eating and I found a slight appeal. The noodles came out a slight bit firmer and actually seemed slightly more plentiful than other ramen varieties. The broth was a different story. It was a bit greasy and had a bit of consistency to it. I can see the tiny pearls of oil floating around the top like glistening gems of invitation. The broth tasted very salty and had a soy like taste to it with a hint of mushroom.
My final ramenrater.com rating is two and a half out of five stars. I am left wanting more – much more. Some dehydrated ginger or lemon grass would be nice, perhaps some dehydrated vegetables of any type. This, however, is a lot to ask of this variety of ramen. What we call Top Ramen in the states is mirrored in Japan as Nissin Demae Ramen. That stuff is quite good with more exotic flavors such as curry, however they as well only feature a ramen cake and a flavor packet. All in all, a bowl of noodles that ranks exactly average to me.

Being the microwave gourmet I am these days, I went for the big sucker pictured here. 1420mg of sodium and some Flonase and I’m starting to perk up! This was a marginal cup noodle. The noodles themselves are rather weak by comparison to Cup Noodle for example. Of course, one plus is the multiple packets. I’m a packet junkie as all Ramen Rater readers know. You get a little dehydrated veggie packet, one with soup base and then one that you add at the end with the mysterious beckoning ‘Finishing Touch.’ The veggies rehydrate quite well and provide a decent amount, but just like all other things, there’s never enough. As I said above, the noodles lacked gumption. As for the ‘Finishing Touch,’ its an oil – probably sesame. All in all, it wasn’t anything to call home about, but nothing to call the police about either. The whole deal surrounding this product is just that its enormous. Get it here.

Sutah: Cup Noodle
Stars: **
Notes: What a strange little cup noodle… A deep red broth with some strange
little bits of something. Not sure what they are – possibly soto? Not sure. One
of the items I was happily able to purchase across the street at the Markette Deli
on State Street in Marysville, Washington. UPC bar code 8801073101197
