The noodles are thin and round with a good chew. Broth has a nice vegetable flavor with notes of peanut and a good thickness. The included garnish hydrated well. 3.75 out of 5.0 stars. JAN bar code 4903088011370.

The noodles come out well – great Tainan chewiness and gauge. The flavor would be great if it weren’t overwhelmed by the saltiness. I think this is coming from the soy sauce. The underlying flavor – which is excellent – is completely trampled on haphazardly. Very disappointing. 1.0 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 471963232172.

Added baked chicken and spring onion. The noodles hydrated well enough – they have a slight crumble to them. The broth doesn’t exactly scream chicken to me; more vegetable. The included bits of vegetable hydrated nicely and were of decent quality. 2.25 out of 5.0 stars. UPC bar code 070662030066.

The strips are pretty good – very crunchy. The tomato flavor is nice – a little more true to the taste of a tomato than you would find in western varieties I should think. They however aren’t my favorite. For a snack, I give these 2.75 out of 5.0 stars. UPC bar code 074410679484."

I must say I like these noodles quite a bit. The have a slightly wider gauge and definitely chewier than many. Curious things they are. As for the flavor, the broth is not abundant and more of a kind of gravy. It’s not thick as gravy, but does have a bit of viscosity to it. I thought the taste was kind of like a curry meets masala with a dab of heat affair. 3.75 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8901595963409."

Noodles were of a standard gauge although straighter than most if that makes sense. The broth was really interesting. Juxtaposed with a strong cilantro (coriander) flavor throughout was this spiciness – Sichuan pepper. It really was the last thing I would have expected from a Japanese instant noodle yet there it was. Very curious and interesting – they just keep coming up with more and more new flavors. 4.0 out of 5.0 stars. JAN bar code 4901071239251.

Added spring onion, 31-44ct shrimp, and shichimi togarashi. The udon came out very well – thick and chewy. The broth has a sweet and soy kind of flavor – I’m not entirely convinced that there isn’t some bonito in there. The tofu is great – very sweet and tasty. 3.75 out of 5.0 stars. JAN bar code 4970083061587."

Added spring onion, Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts and fried onion. The noodles were good – springy and peppy. The flavor was a kind of sesame oil and strong pepper taste. To be honest, I really didn’t expect these to be so spicy. But I didn’t really like the pairing of flavors that went on here, unfortunately. 2.5 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8888056708109."

Added 35-44ct shrimp, Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts and coriander. The noodles steeped great and have a really great chew to them. The broth is a sharp tom yum with a nice creamy look and flavor. The seaweed really goes better as a snack I think, but the ends with the broth while soggy had a nice taste from the broth and the non-wet part has that excellent crispiness that this company’s seaweed snacks have. A really nice little pack of noodles! 5.0 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8858702421034."

Added spring onion and Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts. The noodles came up just a hint al dente – probably due to the shorter cook time. This however worked quite well. The saucer coated all surfaces very well. It was indeed a kimchi flavored affair with a wallop of heat not for the faint of heart. The included kimchi was of good quality and quite nice. 4.25 out of 5.0 stars. UPC bar code 031146038930.

Added frid onion and Salad Cosmo mung beans sprouts. The noodles in this one were extra wide with a hearty chewiness to them.

Unique and tasty. 4.5 out of 5.0 stars.JAN bar code 4902105238448.

The noodles hydrated great ion three minutes. I didn’t expect to like this one much but I did. It was overpoweringly mushroom flavored, yet it was there. It was also a little sweet and salty. In fact, my son Andy liked this and ate it – didn’t expect that! 3.5 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8888056707102."

The noodles have a slight more width than a standard domestic instant. They also have a tiny bit more chewiness – just a little. The broth is more like a sauce and kind of thick.

Added crab stick, Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, coriander, fried onion and chilli flake. I really liked this one. The noodle hydrate well in the 3 minutes of time ad have a soft tooth and a nice gauge. There’s a decent amount of them as well. The broth has a nice buttery sweet crabby kind of deal to it.

Added Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, Dodo fishballs, fried onion and coriander. The noodles are the standard flat ones you’ll find in Cup Noodles varieties from Hong Kong. Still amazes me how many noodles fit into a little cup. The broth has a kind of creamy and spicy hit with a shrimp bump to it. The included tofu puffs are a welcome surprise and the bits of egg are great too. 4.25 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 4897878100187."

Added 3 Dodo fish balls. This one was really interesting. First, it had a kind of acidic and sweet and spicy thing going on that worked extremely well. The broth was indeed thick – kind of like what I have tried in American Chinese restaurants, but just seemed a bit cleaner. The crushed noodle hydrated very well and works perfectly. The included veggies and garnish are fresh and just right. Another great creamy soup – 5.0 out of 5.0 stars.  EAN bar code 8888056833290."

Okay so I did some investigating and found something. In a cooking video by Ching’s Secret, the chef mentions using 225ml water. This package clearly is stating the use of 250ml water. Water dilutes. Starting with the noodles, they’re good – standard instant with nice gauge and a good chew. As for the flavor – if you love garlic, this is definitely for you! Lots of bits of garlic in there and a very strong garlic taste. As for the spicy heat, honestly I’m sad to say it won’t be on this year’s top ten spicy list. I don’t think the 25ml water addition made much of a difference though – maybe a new recipe? But I can certainly say this is one to try if you like spicy things – especially the heat you get from garlic. 4.25 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8901595963362."

Added spring onion and Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts. Noodles are top notch – hydrate well in 4 minutes with a good gauge and chew. The flavor is a kind of tangy and tomato hit. There’s a good spicy bite to it. It tastes like a bright kimchi which I like a lot – and not too overwhelming. The included veggies in the bowl are mostly kimchi and work perfectly. 4.25 out of 5.0 stars.  EAN bar code 8801073211124.
26,2554,https://www.theramenrater.com/2017/09/18/2554-yum-mie-beef-light-soup/,Yum-Mie,Instant Noodles Beef In Light Soup Flavour,Pack,Ghana,3.5,,Finished (click to enlarge). Added beef and crushed red pepper flake. The noodles had more backbone than I’d expect. They are abundant and have a sturdier chew than many. The broth has a salty beef taste to it; not one that seems entirely artificial. 3.5 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 6034000181227.

Added Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, fried onion and shichimi togarashi. The noodles sprung to life in the 2 minute steeping time. They’re a thinner gauge and have a good chew and mouthfeel to them. The broth is fierce – very think. Has a kind of pork chowder consistency. The chashu was nice although I prefer the slices in the Raoh varieties produce a little more. However, it hydrated very well and had good flavor. A very nice bowl of tonkotsu! 4.75 out of 5.0 stars. JAN bar code 4902105230411."

Added Dodo fish ball, squid flower, Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, and coriander. Indeed, the noodles come up nice and plump like I like them. Just a slight bit more density than your average instant. The broth is very good – a mild kind of tom yum – not extremely spicy, but more smooth. So, I liked this one. 4.0 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8888056813148."

Added Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, spring onion and beef. The noodles came out really nice – great gauge and chew. This is the way I like ramyun; it almost has a thin gel on the noodles which I like a lot. The broth is just about as perfect and I can imagine. It has that nice beef flavor and a decent spiciness. It seems like I would go to a fancy restaurant and order it off the menu. Just amazing. The included vegetables hydrated to a T. This is a new favorite – hope it’s around forever. 5.0 out of 5.0 stars! EAN bar code 8801073116442."

The noodles were soft and a little sloppy – really good! There was a lot of heat for sure and a touch of sweetness. I really enjoyed the strong paprika hit from the ground pepper mix. The vegetable bits hydrated very nicely. This was not at all what I expected; it looked like it’d be seafood or more mee goreng. It ended up being quite unique and tasty! 4.5 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8992718853530.

Added Otafuku Yakisoba sauce, Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, beef, spring onion and Kewpie mayonnaise. The noodles worked well in this; a little thicker than a standard instant and a nice quantity. Basically, just heat a little oil in a pan and add beef for a couple minutes, then sprouts, and spring onion and let them cook for a few more. While this goes on, cook up the noodles and drain them."

Added Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, spring onion and fried onion. The noodles are a little broad and floppy. They have a soft chew and really are quite wonderful in the way that they almost bring some extra broth to your mouth. The broth is oily and spicy – definitely Sichuan pepper going on here. A colorful sea of heat with little sesame seeds floating throughout. Impressed! 4.0 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 6914790160179."

The noodles are thin and round in shape. They have a nice chew to them, not overly so, and a decent quantity. Definitely on the premium end of the stick. The broth is a shoyu – kind of has a brewed soy sauce hit to it; kind of a more earthy, almost burnt taste that I wasn’t completely enamored with. However, the thickness and oiliness of the broth was very nice. The chashu pork was good although thin. The menma had a kind of mushroom consistency to it in some parts, slightly crunchy in others – depending of course of the thickness. The mountain of spring onion was pretty epic. 3.75 out of 5.0 stars. JAN bar code 4903088010380."

Added squid, Dodo shrimp and fish ball, coriander, chilli oil, fried onion,  and Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts. I really like this one – starting with the noodles, they’re definitely on the soft comfort food end of the stick. Not only that, there’s a decent quantity. The broth is excellent – a little tart, a little seafood, a lot heavy on flavor and a nice bit of spiciness. The coconut powder really helps out here. 5.0 out of 5.0 stars.  EAN bar code 8888056820023."

The first thing I noticed was that in the steeping method, it says ‘wait until noodles are tender.’ What’s a little troublesome about this is that you have to keep trying non-tender noodles until they’re the desired consistency. I’d say about 3~4 minutes was about right for me.  I would have liked to see more noodles, although many were eaten while I was figuring out how long they should sit in the mug for. The broth has a salty chicken taste which is very good – I definitely think sipping it out of a mug would be preferable than as displayed here. As far as the chicken, there are bits of chicken here and there and they ended up hydrating well. 1.75 out of 5.0 stars.UPC bar code 041000014802."

Added Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, Dodo fishball, spring onion, tau pok, and fried onion. The three minutes I let the cup steep was just right for the noodles to hydrate. Indeed they had a good gauge and chew and quite a decent quantity- always surprises me how much food can come from a cup. The broth is very good – had a rich curry flavor with a nice hit of spiciness. The included carrot and cabbage garnish works extremely well and supplies a fresh little crunch. 5.0 out of 5.0 stars.

Added Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts, shichimi togarashi, spring onion and Kewpie mayo. The noodles are good – and very plentiful. However, the flavor is like a very acrid punch with a kind of yakisoba sauce back to it and it just doesn’t make me very enthusiastic about eating. The included garnish hydrated well and I did enjoy the bit of squid. Unfortunately, I’m experiencing disappointment. 1.5 out of 5.0 stars.  JAN bar code 4901071207342."

The noodles are this and have a soft tooth. The flavor is a chicken with a lot of cumin and a bit of spiciness – not too much to fend off anyone I know, but enough to say ‘hi – I’m spicy.’ Just like the other two, this one gets a lot of added flavor in the broth from the myriad vegetables included. Corn, bell pepper, and onion are omnipresent and just so welcome here. Thank you! 5.0 out of 5.0 stars. UPC bar code 070662401033."

The noodles can be rather long and I found once or twice that during the initial chewing, they could jut out a little and push into my cheek or the roof of my mouth in an unenjoyable way – kind of a bad mouthfeel. The flavor though is pretty good – like a lightly spicy chilli cheese kind of flavor. They’re not bad. For a snack, I give these 3.25 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 4710199109571."

Alright so here we go. The noodles are just awesome – thick and chewy – super thick ramyun with a nice mouthfeel. Now, the flavor speaking of the feeling in my mouth… FIRE! I mean really this is seriously painful stuff. It is not something to give a person who can’t handle heat (although I was quite impressed my 11 year old Andy was able to cope with it although it took a few tortilla chips and 3 peanut butter cups to put out the fire).  My take one the experience is that anyone could eat as much of it as they wanted; as long as they don’t stop. You are greeted warmly  (no pun intended) by a nice sweet kind of flavor at the outset. If you continue to scarf down the noodles, it continues this way. Until you stop. Once you stop, the fire begins. The heat builds to a crescendo I can only liken to putting one’s tongue on a hot stove. Truly this is the hottest I’ve had yet.

Put them together you end up with this broth, which is basically a creamy colored ginger-laden, watery and thin thing that makes me think they were going for something else but though ‘hey, this is pretty good – why not just call it laksa.’ Bummed. 2.0 out of 5.0 stars.

I decided not to add anything to see if 80 calories worth of noodles would be filling. The noodles have a very different texture from anything I’ve tried before. Upon chewing, it’s like they collapse upon pressure in an odd way; not exactly crumbling, but condensing perhaps. Reminds me of chewing up a shredded plant substance, maybe like shredded boiled melon. The miso broth was actually quite well done – rich color and good flavor. The vegetables hydrated well in 30 seconds and were good too. As far as the fillingness, yeah. If you eat the whole pack, which isn’t a huge amount really. I think the 40 calories per serving is a little off, since how would one split the serving? I think this is probably to get away from the sodium level, although that too is much lower than most conventional instant noodles. 4.0 out of 5.0 – a pleasant surprise. UPC bar code 853237003371."

Added a half chicken breast I sauteed with garlic salt and black pepper, corn, carrot, peas and sweet onion. The noodles are kind of odd. They seem kind of like a fresh uncooked noodle yet cooked. It’s like when you chew them, it has a flour kind of aftertaste. I wasn’t sure I liked that so much until I tried the broth.

The direction say to cook until the water is absorbed – about 3-4 minutes. After 6 minutes, there was still a lot of water in there.

Added sweet onion, fried egg and sukiyaki beef. The noodles are thick and have a decent chewiness – chewier than usual I’d say. The flavor is very different. It seems to be a melding of beef, smokiness and a little spiciness in an approximation of barbecue sauce, but not quite. What gets me is it tastes exactly like barbecue potato chips. Exactly. The interesting thing about that to me is that when Paldo came out with their Kokomen, I thought it tasted like Jalapeno Cheddar Chee-tos. I think they might be on to something!

The broth is very good – especially for a vegetarian skewed variety. Usually I find anything vegetarian to have this, well, funk to it. This doesn’t have that. It’s very reminiscent of Shin Ramyun, yet a little less spicy. Add to it the fact that it isn’t as heavy; while the broth is very rich and tastes very good, it seems somewhat fresher and light.

That was a puckerface if I’ve ever seen one! He took it in stride though and finished the rest of the bowl. This is the true baseline for me of the instant noodle.

The broth has of course the green chilli element, but the base, seasoned oil’s onions and regular red chilli powder’s elements retain their character separately as well. One thing that green chilli brings is heat – and not an overwhelmingly painful heat (probably for most but not for me) but one that intermingles with the other flavors.

It’s funny; just like the original instant noodles like 1958, these are supposed to taste like chicken. What I would say about them is chicken wouldn’t be my first thought although I think adding chicken or egg to it is very nice.

I would have thought they’d been mushy and soggy after being in a bag surrounded by a light sauce and veggies, but that’s not the case here. The flavor is a little spicy and a very light ginger and lemongrass taste. The abundance of fresh ingredients is wonderful – really nice to come across a fresh carrot or tidbit of baby corn.

Added some thinly sliced beef, sweet onion, cilantro, jalapeno and Huy Fong Sriracha. The noodles are nice – flat and they have a nice texture. I would have thought them possibly almost gritty as they’re made with brown rice, but they’re very nice. The broth was far less salty than I’m used to with pho that I get at a restaurant. I think it would be even less salty if made with water. The flavors of restaurant style pho are all here though and taste very good. I make it a policy to rate based on the base product and so I’m giving this one a 3.75 However, once paired with beef and vegetables and the trimmings of pho you would find at the restaurant, it becomes absolutely perfect.

Very light and thin and honesty they seem to be happy. It’s a perfect balance of texture and delicateness. They definitely are wonderful to chew. The BBQ sauce? Well, this isn’t what most would think of when you say BBQ sauce – it’s not the 99 cents a bottle stuff at the local grocery store. Instead, it’s a very enjoyable and tasty flavor with nice depth. Soy sauce, garlic, a slight spiciness and other flavors are represented in a wonderful flavor that doesn’t have the usual American ‘slather’ BBQ sauce feel.

The flavor is nice – what you’d expect from yakisoba with a little extra oiliness which works well. The vegetables went well too – decent sized pieces of cabbage rehydrated well.

But he’s awesome so here’s a link to his blog, Andy’s LEGO Stuff. So the stuff on the right – that’s the topokki. The topokki is chewy and hearty and enjoyable! The flavor is wonderful – spicy like gochujang and has just the right spices and stuff; kind of reminds me of canned ravioli sauce but spicy and a ton better. This should replace anything remotely like Spaghetti-O’s on your shelf if you can find it! This is some tasty and really spicy stuff!

They’re soft and oplentiful – and tasty., Not chewy; definitely something made specifically for the US market. The broth is good – a strong lime and chili taste which was enjoyable.

The noodles soaked up most of the liquid and really I must say there is a huge amount of them. The noodles are a little hard to eat; maybe using scissors to cut them before the meal would be helpful as in the way naengmyon is served in Korea. The noodles are thin and don’t separate very well. They aren’t slimy but have a gelatinous texture. They are easily broken by pursing the lips. The broth (what was left after the engorging by the noodles) was interesting,. First, very spicy and has a black pepper taste. Also has an almost vinegary acidity that almost acts like a component of the spiciness. The veggies are disappointing as they don’t really re-hydrate as one would expect. I must say this is a lot better than I expected, but I still definitely cannot eat the the whole thing by any stretch of the imagination. It’s very salty and very heavy. I would say that one of these packs could easily feed two people – kind of has that ‘stick to your ribsy’ kind of way to it like rice and beans in its fillingness.

As I took the first bite of these noodles, I found myself in the same situation, so I tried the scissors – big difference! With that out of the way… The noodles are thin and have an almost gel-like coating. I don’t like this when it comes to bean thread, but it’s different here. The broth is sweet and tasty. No heat like a ramyun – it’s more of a sweet and refreshing flavor. The mustard is different; very interesting!

While they are great as far as texture and chewing go, they have this strange aftertaste that reminds me slightly of what a freshly opened jar of vitamins has (kind of funny since they purport their rich vitamin content). The broth is mushroom flavored for sure. I must admit I expected it to taste worse than it does, what with the taste of the powder. Long story short, if you have to eat something that says healthy and you like mushrooms and all things earthy, languishing in health food stores and the like, I would say this is for you.

The broth has a spiciness to it and was almost slightly acidic or had a kind of citrus punch to it – was interesting. The veggies were great – they got pretty good sized and were semi-prevalent.

This is definitely something different for me – let’s see here… The noodles by themselves aren’t bad – unseasoned so not a lot of flavor, but a nice consistency. Once dipped in the sauce, it’s a completely different story. The sauce is very soy and wasabi inspired and has a nice wasabi sting to it. It’s kind of like bibim naengmeon but with a dipping attribute! What’s interesting about this is that after trying it, I couldn’t imagine it working as well as it does if the components were hot as in a common ramyun or soupless noodle dish.

It is seething with onion! It has a sweet and spicy taste to it. Spot on! The veggies: okay, see that on top in the middle? That’s a slice of garlic. Underneath are some mushrooms. The garlic tastes like a piece of garlic sliced thin; it isn’t mushy – it’s crunchy! The mushrooms are quite good too!  If you are a fan of spicy Korean noodles and really like onions a lot, this is definitely for you.

Usually I’ve found that with instant noodle varieties that are about heat are not so much about flavor – this one is spicy as well as tasty. The veggies are there and in a decent amount.

I added a little bit of store brand stir-fry vegetables. The noodles are wonderful – the same as what you find in the other Indomie ‘Special’ varieties that you can get over here. The flavor was not what I expected. It was light and mellow – kind of like a coconut cream with a light hint of chilli and light sweetness as well as some spices. It was bland in comparison to other Indomie flavors I’ve had. The garnish is great – little tofu bits are really good. This was a definite departure from what I’m used to with Indomie’s offerings and I am really curious to see what else I’ll find during this week of samplings!

The noodles bulked up nicely and had an interesting texture – the outermost layer was kind of like bean thread while the inside was firmer. The broth is pretty good stuff – has a nice, spicy jalapeno heat to it and had a good chicken flavor. I would not say though that this broth tastes as much like Jalapeno Cheese Cheetos, though.

The broth is very interesting – kind of salty and kind of buttery – but absolutely not fishy. It’s got a thickness to it – not an overly greasy kind of thickness either. Lots of green onion bits here and there – they look nice and maybe add a little flavor to the broth. The Basa fish? Well, there’s not a huge amount of it but it’s good – not really fishy at all – like a whitefish. I will say that I do like Vietnamese catfish instant noodles!

Added some Huy Fong Sriracha hot sauce, Krazy Mixed Up Salt and fried shallots on the eggs. I also dropped some kizami shoga (pickled ginger) in the mix. Wow – this is great stuff!

Finally, the eel. It is wonderful – much better than I expected. It ties everything together and adds a nice flavor. If you haven’t had eel before, it’s a very light tasting meat and this being my first time tasting a cooked eel, it has the texture of a slightly chewy tuna and almost a hint of that flavor.

I added some Bird’s Eye Stir Fry veggies and a little roast turkey breast lunch meat on the  right. Also tossed in a little kizami shoga (pickled ginger) as well as some Ajishima Kim Chi Furikake. I like the noodles – they did really well for being a microwaved meal component. I added about a sixteenth of a cup of extra water and I think that may have been a good idea to avoid dryness. The sauce is excellent – a very mellow soy sauce kind of flavor. The supplied veggies are good – fresh tasting corn and cabbage going on. I really enjoyed this – 3.75 out of 5.0 stars.

The noodles are good – lots of them and they suck up the flavors nicely. A little chewy but not overly so. The broth is crazy hot – almost too hot for me but I persevere!

I also added some kizami shoga (hot pink pickled ginger) and a couple dashes of Texas Pete hot sauce on top of the eggs. Let’s start with the noodles. They are soft and very wide – not chewy but not mushy either. The broth is salty and rich in flavor – soy sauce and a nice hint of seafood.  The tofu was very nice – tender and delectable. I relished every bite. This is a 5.0 out of 5.0 star affair BEFORE the added eggs and shallots, etc. Great stuff!!! Happy Martin Luther King Jr. day! UPC barcode 4902105201954."

These moroheiya leaves must be worth it, right? I rmember how much I truly detested the green tea Chlorella noodles I had a while back – gag reflex, engage! So let’s see here… The noodles are of good texture. The flavor is really good with the seasonings – until around chew number four or five when the funky earthy flavor kicks in. Then it’s kind of a gobble quick before more flavor happens. The veggies on the other hand were awesome – especially the corn! Weird. Of all the moroheiya filled GreeNoodle products I’ve tried thus far, this is definitely the best. A bit of sweet and spicy and good veggies despite the funky aftertaste. 3.0 out of 5.0 stars. Generous. UPC barcode 8850987139253 – get it here. If your want to try a free sample of the noodles without seasonings, check it out here."

Well, here goes: the noodles were in a word, mushy. They had the right amount of steeping time too. I’m not detracting points though, because this was a nice kind of mushy; the kind you’d like to have with rice noodles in a cup – you can break em off with your lips. The broth is salty and has some hints of mushroom. Very mild and approaching bland, but not quite there. If you’re looking for something light and mushroomy, this is the ticket.

While this was pretty horrible, it wasn’t as horrible as I expected. First, the noodles were not too bad themselves; they weren’t as clumpy as usual. The broth was all but gone and the bean things were as funky and odd as always. The problem as with all of the Baijia products I’ve tried thus far was the flavor. First, it’s spicy – nothing wrong with that, but it’s like a ridiculously strong black pepper kind of spicy. Also, it’s very salty  too.

Now let’s get down to business. As mentioned before, I added two eggs that cooked in the pot with the noodles. This is pretty standard. The noodles are of a good quality. They are chewy but not overly so. There is also a happy abundance of noodles, making for a decent sized meal. The broth is fine –  nice spiciness that you would expect from Shin Ramyun but it has an added depth and richness. I taste a lot of onion, garlic and meaty tones. As for the veggies and beef, I think that’s where this bowl shines. The beef is excellent – like little pieces of steak amongst the noodles – chewy and they taste fresh and good. The vegetables re-hydrate very nicely – and they aren’t tiny little bits! They’re of a decent size and of good quality. Long story short, I would happily say that this is one of the better South Korean instant noodles I’ve tried, possibly ranking up in the top two or three. I will say I like it better than the original Nong Shim Shin Ramyun as well. I’m giving this one 4.75 out of 5.0 stars. Why not 5.0 stars?

Added an egg. The rice noodles were quite good – they weren’t weak, but almost melted in my mouth – reminiscent of the old Mrs. Grass soup I remember from being a kid with the flu. The broth ended up being thicker and heartier than most. The flavor was almost buttery and very satisfying – a hint of ginger – not too much, not too little. I would term this as succulent. I really enjoyed it – 4.25 out of 5.0 stars! Find it here."

The noodles are very reminiscent of MAMA’s noodles. They’re seasoned on their own and can be eaten straight. The veggies are reasonably ample and very nice. The broth is perfect. I like how it wasn’t overly hot or overly lemony; it was a perfect balance of the two. Also, it didn’t seem as salty as other Tom Yum instant noodles. I’m going to say that this is the finest Tom Yum flavor instant noodle I’ve sampled yet and give it 4.0 out of 5.0 stars. Truly a pleasant surprise. Get it here."

So I made this for my lady for breakfast and had a little taste of the broth and noodle. She liked it – she thought the mushroom flavor was nice and subtle and not like the nasty stuff she tried before – which was the Crystal mushroom bowl noodle of ages back. She’s a mushroom fan and though it deserved three stars. I am not a big mushroom fan but they’re growing on me (not really – I don’t have a fungus problem har har) but I did like how the broth wasn’t overwhelmingly mushroomy. I agree with her. 3.0 out of 5.0 stars! You can find it here.

They were surprisingly chewy! Broth wasn’t bad – I think a bit less salt would’ve beenn fine. The curry flavor is there and the heat is interesting. Not what I exactly expected. I’m giving this one a 3.5 out of 5.0 stars. It’s a big bowl of Korean curry soup and I like it.

It’s really neat and cool to see something so different than what I usually get, but really not that great or terrible."

Mushrooms have a flavor that remind me of an old attic window, peering out at a dark and cloudy day in February.

The onions lent a nice extra freshness to the bowl of noodles, which I am afraid would’ve been rather boring without them. All in all, not the greatest but not too bad; its got potential. Perhaps add some tuna or shrimp? Onions for sure. I’m going to be nice and give this one a 2.5 out of 5 stars. It really wasn’t all that impressively flavored. No sea tangle of seaweed – I think that’d have been a nice touch.. I feel very satisfied with my face."
