Added Dodo shrimp and fish ball, spring onion, and Salad Cosmo mung bean sprouts. Noodles were good and plump – on point as always. The broth is a creamy chowder-like affair with a little spiciness – the pepper rings in the garnish definitely liven things up, should you choose to eat one.

Added baked chicken, Sichuan pepper powder, sesame seed, and spring onion. While the noodle was very nice – a very thin dry noodle from Taiwan, the flavor for this reviewer was horrible. Just can’t win today as this is the third one I’ve had I’ve disliked. The combo of peppers going on here reminds me of the smell of detergents and solvents used to clean a dirty bathroom (note I’m not saying it contains anything like that, I just don’t enjoy the odor).

At one point, my entire body was tingling violently, throbbing from head to toe and slightly numb. This could have been the cusp of going into shock.

I don’t find it to be ‘run for the hills’ spicy but it is spicy. The black pepper flavor is just a plain menace and isn’t one I like.

I liked how a little creamer was in there to give the broth a kind of heartiness. The bell pepper did well, the shrimp was there and the only complaint was that they were small and only a scant few.

So we decided with the yellow bits in there that they could be menma (bamboo shoot) and the white circles with the yellow pips could be eggs. Then again, the other yellow stuff could be corn so it could be miso ramen. It took us a while to figure this thing out (see video) but it was an enjoyable experience as we cursed at it. Definitely wasn’t something I could do myself with my low-vision issues, however, Andy was able to see the colors and figure out the instructions pretty well – we were able to work together on it and finally get it done. Lot of extra pieces at the end (which are mentioned) however I don’t think we could have built anything with them and since they’re a definite choking hazard and I’m not keen on hoarding, we chucked them.

They didn’t come out poorly either – they’re pretty decent. Now for the broth. The broth was something that my flu symptoms didn’t know how to combat. I had a bit of the noodle, then some broth and after about ten seconds, I felt this pain in my gut; like the I’m either going to vomit or shit my pants kind of gut pain. I had taken some cough syrup about a half hour before, too. Was trying these while sick a good idea? Was this a bad batch of noodles? A big yes to the first and a definite no to the second. I would have thought that if anything the spiciness would have been downplayed a bit since my tastebuds are all jacked up, but I have a feeling it amplified the spicy effect. I think the gut pain was the stuff hitting a gut full of medication and post nasal drippings. Luckily, Jay is going to send another pack of these and I will definitely try again once I’m feeling better. One thing I’ll say – this is a lot of noodles and broth and exceedingly spicy as well. After the rematch, I have fcome to a conclusion. This is the spiciest instant noodle I’ve ever had. It burned bad, twsited my gut up, laid waste to my soul.

I do like the little note of spiciness I get from the chilli powder. I will say however that the chicken has that kind of simulation flavor I’m not really all that fond of.

When I first tried their white curry in 2013, it was much different. It definitely had less garlic and although I love garlic, it kind of gives everything a kind of monotone hit which really bums me out. Howver, there’s a lot to it and it’s as rich as can be.

Okay so I did some investigating and found something. In a cooking video by Ching’s Secret, the chef mentions using 225ml water. This package clearly is stating the use of 250ml water. Water dilutes. Starting with the noodles, they’re good – standard instant with nice gauge and a good chew. As for the flavor – if you love garlic, this is definitely for you! Lots of bits of garlic in there and a very strong garlic taste. As for the spicy heat, honestly I’m sad to say it won’t be on this year’s top ten spicy list. I don’t think the 25ml water addition made much of a difference though – maybe a new recipe? But I can certainly say this is one to try if you like spicy things – especially the heat you get from garlic. 4.25 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8901595963362."

The broth is a shoyu – kind of has a brewed soy sauce hit to it; kind of a more earthy, almost burnt taste that I wasn’t completely enamored with. However, the thickness and oiliness of the broth was very nice. The chashu pork was good although thin. The menma had a kind of mushroom consistency to it in some parts, slightly crunchy in others – depending of course of the thickness.

The first thing I noticed was that in the steeping method, it says ‘wait until noodles are tender.’ What’s a little troublesome about this is that you have to keep trying non-tender noodles until they’re the desired consistency. I’d say about 3~4 minutes was about right for me.  I would have liked to see more noodles, although many were eaten while I was figuring out how long they should sit in the mug for. The broth has a salty chicken taste which is very good – I definitely think sipping it out of a mug would be preferable than as displayed here. As far as the chicken, there are bits of chicken here and there and they ended up hydrating well. 1.75 out of 5.0 stars.UPC bar code 041000014802."

First off, these have a very nice crunch to them without being hard. They’re crispy and very ‘poppable’ due to their size. As for the flavor, they are salty with a seaweed taste and a little sweetness as well. If you like seaweed and crunchy stuff, this should be up your alley. For a snack, I’ll give this 3.5 out of 5.0 stars. UPC bar code 074410732004."

This is as far from pad thai as I can even express in words. It’s like someone gave a broken description of pad thai to someone who has short term memory problems and no taste buds a week prior and told them to make it.

You are greeted warmly  (no pun intended) by a nice sweet kind of flavor at the outset. If you continue to scarf down the noodles, it continues this way. Until you stop.

The noodles are extremely plentiful and really soft and floppy. This is perfect and the seasonings and liquids combine with them very well. The flavor is like an almost beefy and tasty lasagna but with Sichuan pepper and other spices going on. The more you eat, the spicier it gets – heat, upon heat, upon heat! The pain! I really expected this to probably be really salty and have a strong vinegar taste but I was completely mistaken. I love this. 5.0 out of 5.0 stars.  EAN bar code 6926410331821."

The garnish bits are where I notice the interesting things – there’s a little bit of onion and mushroom. Then there are what seem to be meatballs or sausage bits which definitely have a taste I’m not accustomed to. It’s pretty good but also kind of strange.

The noodles in this one were flat instead of round. They came out very nicely. The flavoring however was just strange. I expected maybe something of a Korean-Chinese fusion dish, but those are hearty and rich and not savory and sweet. In fact, this one was a little too sweet for me. The thinly sliced bamboo shoots don’t work for me either; leaving them whole would be nicer I think. What’s more, it has a kind of chemically aftertaste; like chlorine or soap. 0.0 out of 5.0 stars.

The curry taste is much stronger (the old version called for 450ml water and this one calls for 400ml) – not only that, the little sachet of chilli pepper flake just puts it over the top.

The flavor is a serious smack of Ghost pepper; it’s about 20 minutes since I had a couple bites and it’s still burning my lips and tongue pretty good. What’s neat is that it tastes good as well, something many that are extremely hot don’t offer; sesame and soy sauce notes come through despite the fiery Ghost pepper blaze.

The noodles are your standard instant – regular gauge and soft chew. The broth however had me confused from the start. The acidic scent of the powder base had me thinking asaam laksa, but the oil smelled like curry. Put them together you end up with this broth, which is basically a creamy colored ginger-laden, watery and thin thing that makes me think they were going for something else but though ‘hey, this is pretty good – why not just call it laksa.’ Bummed. 2.0 out of 5.0 stars.
