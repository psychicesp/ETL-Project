UPC bar code 767921011217.Finished (click to enlarge). Okay so I did some investigating and found something. In a cooking video by Chingâ€™s Secret, the chef mentions using 225ml water. This package clearly is stating the use of 250ml water. Water dilutes. Starting with the noodles, theyâ€™re good â€“ standard instant with nice gauge and a good chew. As for the flavor â€“ if you love garlic, this is definitely for you! Lots of bits of garlic in there and a very strong garlic taste. As for the spicy heat, honestly Iâ€™m sad to say it wonâ€™t be on this yearâ€™s top ten spicy list. I donâ€™t think the 25ml water addition made much of a difference though â€“ maybe a new recipe? But I can certainly say this is one to try if you like spicy things â€“ especially the heat you get from garlic. 4.25 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 8901595963362.Finished (click to enlarge).
